# UEE2304-Data-Structure
Homework of [Data Structure](https://course.nctu.edu.tw/Course/CrsOutline/show.asp?Acy=104&Sem=1&CrsNo=1077&lang=en-us) at NCTU ECE in 2015 fall.

## Chapter 1: Basic concepts
A **data structure** is an aggregation of atomic and composite data into a set with defined relationships. A **abstract data type** is a data declaration packaged together with the operations that are meaningful for the data tyoe.

### Model for an ADT
- ADT Operations: Data are entered, accessed, modified and deleted through the external interface (public functions). Private functions and data are not allowed to be accessed straighfoward. 
- ADT Data Structure: we hide the implementation from the user while being able to store different data (e.g. stacks, queues, lists, BST, AVL trees, B-trees, heaps, graphs, etc.)

### ADT Implementation
One can implement ADT lists by 2 basic structures: arrays and linked lists.

## Generic Code for ADTs
Generic code allow us to write one set of code and apply it to any data type. In C, there're mainly 2 features: pointer to void and pointer function.
- Pointer to void: 
```
void *p;  int i = 3;  float f = 7.5;
p = &i; printf("%d", *(int*)p);   // 3
p = &f; printf("%f", *(float*)p); // 7.5
```
  remember that we cannot use `*p` without casting. That is, **a pointer to void cannot be dereferenced**. Then we can use pointer to void to describe a example -- node structure
```
typedef struct node {
  void* data;
  struct node* link;
} NODE;
```
- Pointer to function: `int (*ptrToCmpFun)(void*, void*);`
Below, we define a generic function which return the larger one without knowing exact data type.
```
void* larger (void* dataPtr1, void* dataPtr2, int (*ptrToCmpFun)(void*, void*)){
  if((*ptrToCmpFun)(dataPtr1, dataPtr2) > 0)
    return dataPtr1;
  else
    return dataPtr2;
}

int compare(void* a, void* b){
  if(*(int*)a > *(int*)b)
    return 1;
  else
    return -1;
}

// int a = 1, b = 2;
// int lrg = *(int*)larger(&a, &b, compare); // lrg <- 2
```
