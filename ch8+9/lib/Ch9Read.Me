This "Read.Me" file accompanies the programs for Chapter 9, "Data Structures: A Pseudocode Approach Using C"-------------------------------------------------------In addition to the functions created in the text, thereare three funcitons needed to complete the heap: heapCount,heapFull, and heapEmpty.We created a test driver to verify the heap ADT. It is included. As indicated above, however, you will needto write the missing functions.      -------------------------------------------------------Programs:P9-01.h		Heap DeclarationP9-02.h		Create Heap Application InterfaceP9-03.h		Insert Heap Application InterfaceP9-04.h		Internal Reheap Up FunctionP9-05.h		Delete Heap Application InterfaceP9-06.h		Internal Reheap Down FunctionP9-07.c		Priority Queue ImplementationHeader File:P9-heap.h	Heap ADTTest Driver:P9-testHeap.c  Special Heap Test DriverG & F August 2004
